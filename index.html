        <ol>
        
            <li>His musical performance in the school play, Bye Bye Birdie, was really really good. He sang from inside his car while on stage. Although there were some minor setbacks (the audience was unable to hear his solo due to the car windows being stuck shut), his singing was still top notch. 
            <li>He once worked at Galaxy Coffee under the stolen identity of one his students, Brendon Small.</li>
            <li>He drunk-purchased swords from a TV infomercial. Spoiler: He wasn't able to return them.</li>
