css has weightings

ID has bigger weighting than class and tag.
ID is almost like a class, cept it can only be on one element. 
ID "#first"

an inline style on a style attribute takes more weight than an ID

class ".small"

tag name has smaller weighting than class name

span inherits its parents container/boxes styling

make all spans italic.


make all spans in all h2 have strike thru.
        h2 span{
        font-style:line-through;
            }
            
href means where the heck is it?!
